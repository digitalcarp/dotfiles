Configuration instructions and files for setting up a Linux developer environment.

### CLI Utilities
If the environment does not allow sudo for installing programs, consider [Linuxbrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux).

* [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - faster grep with better defaults
* [fd-find](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) - faster find with better defaults
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - fuzzy finder w/ rg and fd integration
* [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) - vim text editor
* [tmux (>=3.2)](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) - terminal multiplexer (pre-installed version may be old)

### Fonts
Install a patched font from [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) like DejaVu Sans Mono. Place the extracted files in a directory like `~/.fonts`.
